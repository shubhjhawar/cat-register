# cat-register

this is a backend project performing all the tasks required in the mail.

I have used PostgreSQL as my database, feel free to change it before using it for yourself.

Also, a requirement.txt file has been provided containing all the necessary packages for this project to work.

I did not push the virtual environment because it does not come under normal practice, also there was a lot of data in that.

task- is the django project
